A* works by combining two functions:

g(n): The cost from the start node to the current node 
𝑛
n.
h(n): A heuristic estimate of the cost from node 
𝑛
n to the goal node. This is also known as the heuristic function and is problem-specific.
The algorithm aims to minimize the total cost function f(n), where:

f(n)=g(n)+h(n)
g(n) ensures that we consider the actual distance traveled.
h(n) helps guide the algorithm toward the goal efficiently by estimating the remaining distance.
