Initialize:

Start with an initial set of observed symptoms.
Store this set in a priority queue (open list) with an initial score of 0.
Evaluate Goal State:

Check if the current set of symptoms matches a known disease (goal state).
If it matches, return the diagnosis (disease).
Generate Successors:

If the current symptom set does not match a known disease, generate all possible next states (symptom sets) by adding a new symptom that hasn’t been observed yet.
Evaluate Heuristic:

For each new symptom set (successor), calculate the heuristic value. This value represents how many symptoms match the expected symptoms of a known disease.
Sort Symptom Sets:

Add the evaluated symptom sets to the priority queue (open list).
Sort the queue based on the heuristic values (ascending order), so the best matching symptom set is processed next.
Repeat:

Pop the symptom set with the best heuristic value from the queue and repeat steps 2–5 until a diagnosis is found (goal state is reached).
Return Diagnosis:

Once the goal state is reached, return the corresponding disease as the diagnosis.
