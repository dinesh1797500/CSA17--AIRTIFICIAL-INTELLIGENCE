State Representation:

state(MonkeyPos, BoxPos, HasBanana) represents the current state.
MonkeyPos represents the monkey's location, which can be a place on the floor (a, b, etc.) or on_box if the monkey is on top of the box.
BoxPos represents the box's location.
HasBanana is true if the monkey has grasped the banana, false otherwise.
Move Actions:

walk(MonkeyPos, NewPos): The monkey can walk from one position to another.
push_box(MonkeyPos, NewPos): The monkey can push the box to a new location if it is at the same location as the box.
climb_box: The monkey can climb onto the box if it is at the same position as the box.
grasp_banana: If the monkey is on the box and has not grasped the banana, it can grasp the banana.
Plan/2 Predicate:

plan/3 recursively finds a sequence of moves that leads from the initial state to the goal state. It constructs the plan as a list of moves.
solve/1 Predicate:

solve/1 finds a sequence of moves (Solution) that will solve the problem by transitioning from the initial state to the goal state.
